			<h4>Site information: Don't know what you want to eat or where to dine tonight? Then Hungger is the app for you. This site models that application and helps you decide what to eat in a very simple process. It was designed to be simple for the user by modelling Tinder but made for food. The app idea comes from Soichi, a UW student trying to get in the informatics major.</h4>
